    <h3>Bolognese Sauce</h3>
    <p>
        Dice 1 of the onions and 3 of the carrots. Cook the onions on low heat in a big pot with olive oil and then add the carrot cubes and the garlic clove(smashed).<br>
        On high heat add the ground beef and beef boullion and cook until it's nice and brown. Then add the tomato sauce, extract, wine and 1 bay leaf.<br>
        Season it with salt and pepper and lower the heat to the point where the sauce is barely boiling. Leave it to cook for roughly 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Bechamel Sauce</h3>
    <p>
        In a seperate pot pour in the milk, add some pepper, the 2nd bay leaf and 1 onion and one carrot both sliced in half and bring the milk <strong>slowly</strong> to boil.<br>
        Afterwards tkake it of the heat, cover the pot and let it simmer for 15 minutes.<br>
        Pour the milk through a sieve into a ptcher. Put the pot back on the heat and melt the butter in it.<br>
        After the butter melted, on low heat, add the flour slowly to butter while constantly stiring it.<br>
        Don't let the mixture form clumps or brown from too high heat. After the whole flour was added, take the pot from the stove and slowly add the milk into it while constant stiring.<br>
        Make sure that no clumps are formed. Once the whole milk is added and the butter is well mixed in put the pot back on the heat and slowly heat it while stiring until the mixture <br>
        reaches a thick, saucy consistence. Season it with nutmeg and salt.

    <p>
        Grease your oven dish with butter, preheat your oven at 180Â°C and cut the ham in small slices. Add some bolognese sauce to the oven dish and spread it.<br>
        Then add some of the Bechamel cover it with some of the lasagne pasta then add some of the ham and mozzarella and repeat the process.<br>
        The last layer will be bolognese and Bechamel, covered by the parmesan cheese. Let it cook in the oven for 45 minutes.<br>
